### Today I learned...

#### React

My goal was to explore the event behavior of React components. So I forked the [React Grid of Cards](https://codepen.io/whagan/pen/rNyZEzL) and set about creating a `switchPositions` function. This function merely shuffles the cards.

I was less interested in the shuffle function (in fact, the shuffle function I employ is [not adequately random](https://medium.com/@nitinpatel_20236/how-to-shuffle-correctly-shuffle-an-array-in-javascript-15ea3f84bfb)), and I instead focused my attention on React event handling.

I [achieved my goal](https://codepen.io/whagan/pen/eYvPVqq) and the components work.

The most interesting aspect of today's work was researching how an event in one component is able to change the state of another component. In this case, I passed data and a function (`switchPositions`) in the parent component (`Deck`) to a child component (`Button`). [This example](https://jsfiddle.net/ybeaz/njLx57u4/) proved to be a great guide and help.
