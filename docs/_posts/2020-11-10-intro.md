Quick introduction: 

My name is Will Hagan and I live in Memphis, TN. This semester I will complete my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of Memphis. I also have a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. I hope to continue my studies after graduation. 

This blog will be a record of my work and interests.
