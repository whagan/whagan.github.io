#### Web Programming

My goal for today is to have a functioning domains => theory landing page for this website. This page will include a section for algorithms and data structures. In the future, I hope to include other fields such as Combinatorial Optimization and Network Flows.

I will further divide algorithms into the following:
* analysis of algorithms
* searching
* sorting
* greedy algorithms
* divide and conquer
* graph algorithms
* dynamic programming
* recursion

I will divide data structures into the following:
* array
* linked list
* stack
* queue
* binary tree
* binarty search tree
* heap
* hashing
* graph
* trees
