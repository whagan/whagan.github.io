# June 28, 2021

#### Web Programming

Over the weekend I was able to integerate my [Sidebar](https://codepen.io/whagan/pen/mdWZvOw) react component with this jekyll site. It's on the default page. 

Not very good-looking, but it's a start. I lookforward to adding more features to this site.

Working on an updated [Sidebar](https://codepen.io/whagan/pen/vYmYmbX). Must give a lot of credit to [this pen](https://codepen.io/albertoleon/pen/RmNZmK).

#### Upcoming

Vacation on Thursday. I need to knock out at least two or three more Leetcodes before I leave. 

I'm really hoping to dive into some data engineering stuff soon.
