#### System Administration

Worked Chapter 1 in [Van Vugt](https://www.sandervanvugt.com/).

Tidbits:
1. I need a clearer understanding of disk partitions. I'm especially interested in **LVM** and file systems such as **ext4** and **xfs**.
2. **Software Selection** in the **Installation Summary** is full of interesting add-ons.
3. Other than **Installation Destination**, **Network & Host Name**, and **Software Selection**, most of the installation options are pretty straightforward.
