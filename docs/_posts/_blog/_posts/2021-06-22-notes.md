# June 22, 2021

### Today I learned...

#### Web Programming

[Sidebar Codepen](https://codepen.io/whagan/pen/mdWZvOw)

Currently working on a sidebar for the website. Spent most of tonight working in Codepen (check link above). Also, [this blog post](https://blog.campvanilla.com/reactjs-dropdown-menus-b6e06ae3a8fe) proved to be very helpful.

#### Theory

Worked on binary tree traversals (preorder, postorder, and inorder). 

#### Upcoming

Hope to keep up with Leetcode (maybe 4 or 5 a week). 

I would also like to finish the sidebar pen.

Also, [this](http://www.sunlab.org/teaching/cse6250/fall2019/env/) might be in my near future. I would like to make cheatsheets for local and cloud (Azure) installation.
