# June 10, 2021

#### Python

Python list operations such as `append()` and `insert()` return `None`. To work with a list after an `append()` or `insert()` method without those changes becoming part of the original list, create a copy of the original list and work on that.

#### React

Today I learned about Context in React.
1. In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome. Context provides a way to share values between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.
2. Context is designed to share data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React components.
3. However, in the documentation, Context seems to apply mostly with UI aspects such as theme or preferred language. It's probably not what I'm looking for to [complete this small education project](https://codepen.io/whagan/pen/eYvPVqq).
