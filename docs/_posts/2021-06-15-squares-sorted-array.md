### Leetcode

**Problem 977 Squares of a Sorted Array** 

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return an array of **the squares of each number** sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Follow up:** Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial. Could you find an `O(n)` solution using a different approach?
