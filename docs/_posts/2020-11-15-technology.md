Over the last few years, I gained experience with various software technologies in order to complete class assignments. Each time I was exposed to a new technology, I immediately took it out of the box and started playing with it. That is to say, I immediately plunged into the assignment and did not take time to appreciate the technology itself. I wish now that I had shown more discipline.

Technology evolves, of course, and a firm grasp of the fundamentals is what matters most (or so we've been told). But who said you can't shoot for both?

Let's start with web frameworks. According to Wikipedia, a web framework is '[a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework)' Common web frameworks include [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), and [Spring MVC](https://spring.io/).

Over the next few weeks, I hope to install each of those frameworks, complete a small tutorial project, and then completely uninstall the framework. I will take notes along the way, paying close attention to the frameworks themselves.

Here is a list of books signifying nothing:

* _Combinatorial Optimization: Algorithms and Complexity_ (with Kenneth Steiglitz). Prentice-Hall, 1982.
* _Computational Complexity_. Addison Wesley, 1994.
* _Algorithms_ (coauthored with Sanjoy Dasgupta and Umesh Vazirani). McGraw-Hill, September 2008.
