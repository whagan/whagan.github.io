### Django

This is the first  in a series of posts. With this series, I want to explore several different web frameworks in order to gain a basic familiarity. I plan to install each framework and complete a short tutorial project.

We'll start with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

First, my PC specs:

#### Work PC

Windows Edition | Processor | Installed Memory (RAM) | System Type
--------------- | --------- | ---------------------- | -----------
Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard | Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5-2620 v3 @ 2.40GHz 2.40 GHz | 12.0 GB | 64-bit Operating System, x64-based processor

For a shell, I use Git BASH povided by [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). 

#### Home PC

Linux Edition | Processor | Installed Memory (RAM) | System Type
--------------- | --------- | ---------------------- | -----------
Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS | Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4590 @ 3.30 GHz | 8.0 GB | 64-bit Operating System, x64-based processor

For a shell, I use [GNOME Terminal 3.28.2](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Terminal).


For a basic Django installation, the [docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/install/) requires Python.
