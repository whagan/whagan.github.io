_I've got a little list..._ Ko-Ko by way of Wm. Gass

I'm constantly composing little lists. Indeed, list-making may be my only natural talent.

A sturdy list remains the best encouragement. What do you desire? And can you have it now? No? Then merely add what you want to this list and it shall be guarded against your forgetfulness, which threatens worse than your dispossession of it. Forgetting what we want hurts more than not having it, and anyway, all hurts are fires, according to Gass. 

Speaking of Gass, The essay _I've Got a Little List_ is collected in _Tests of Time: Essays_, published 2002. Here are a few prose excerpts to whet the appetite:

* "Nowadays, despite our equalitarian and plural society (or perhaps because of it), we are obsessed by hierarchies in the form of lists."
* "These orders, unlike one's laundry list, are imaginary. The choices set down are like the interpretations of ink blots, only revelatory of their maker. But if the comforts are mere enumeration are shallow and illusory, so are most comforts."
* "Lists are juxtapositions, and exhibit many of the qualities of collage. The names which appear on them lack their normal syntactical companions. Most lists are terse, minimal, bald; they are reminders, commands, aspirations."
* "Some of us, this very moment, unbeknownst, are being dropped from an invitation list."
* "If I am making an action into a list, I shall have to divide it the way the flight of Zeno's arrow was divided, the way a camera would record it, because a camera is a list maker, the film nothing but a series of shots in the order of their snapping."

Within computer science, there are many fields of study ("... obsessed by hierarchies in the form of lists"). Here is a short list of fields I cribbed from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science):

* Theoretical computer science
* Computer Systems and computational processes
* Applied computer science

And here are some (sub)fields:

* Theory of computation
* Data structures and algorithms
* Programming language theory and formal methods
* Artificial intelligence
* Computer architecture and organisation
* Concurrent, parallel and distributed computing
* Computer networks
* Computer security and cryptography
* Databases and data mining
* Computational science, finance and engineering

And here are some (sub(sub))fields:

* Automata theory
* Computability theory
* Computational complexity theory
* Analysis of algorithms
* Algorithm design
* Data structures
* Combinatorial optimization
* Compiler design
* Natural language processing
* Pattern recognition
* Microarchitecture
* Multiprocessing
* Computer performance
* Systems architecture
* Operating systems
* Embedded system

Moving forward, I might throw a list in each post. The list probably will not have any significance for anyone other than myself.
