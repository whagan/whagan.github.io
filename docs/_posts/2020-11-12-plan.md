_I've got a little list..._ Ko-Ko by way of Gass

I'm constantly composing little lists. 

List-making may be my only natural talent, and for the aspirationist, a sturdy list remains the best succor. 

What do you desire? And can you have it now? If not, merely add it to this list and it shall be guarded against your forgetfulness, which threatens worse than your dispossession of it. 

Forgetting what we want hurts and hurts more than not having it but no matter: all hurts are fires, according to Gass. 

The essay _I've Got a Little List_ is collected in _Tests of Time: Essays_ by William H. Gass, published 2002. Here are a few prose excerpts to whet the appetite:

1. "Nowadays, despite our equalitarian and plural society (or perhaps because of it), we are obsessed by hierarchies in the form of lists."
2. "These orders, unlike one's laundry list, are imaginary. The choices set down are like the interpretations of ink blots, only revelatory of their maker. But if the comforts are mere enumeration are shallow and illusory, so are most comforts."
3. "Lists are juxtapositions, and exhibit many of the qualities of collage. The names which appear on them lack their normal syntactical companions. Most lists are terse, minimal, bald; they are reminders, commands, aspirations."
4. "Some of us, this very moment, unbeknownst, are being dropped from an invitation list."
5. "If I am making an action into a list, I shall have to divide it the way the flight of Zeno's arrow was divided, the way a camera would record it, because a camera is a list maker, the film nothing but a series of shots in the order of their snapping."
