There are too many carnival barkers out there in the world jostling for our attention. Do we really need another? No, we do not. I prefer to keep to myself, and that has been my prerogative since before the dawn of social media. 

However, I've found that I work harder when I have some skin in the game. So now I'm reaching out with this blog. I've always been curious and sometimes my curiousity is constructive - I follow it down new paths worthy of exploration. Sometimes, however, my curiosity is an engine of diversion - I've barely started down one path before I embark down another.

Perhaps this blog will help keep me on track. That is certainly my hope.
